		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures (Patty Pieper)<h1/>
			<p>This lab was supposed to create a local file structure, thus linking files together.</p>

		<h2>Challenges<h2/>
		<div>
			<p>I enjoyed formatting this website, but have had a lot of trouble when actually connecting the links on the numbered list. With that being said, I was able to add images and connect a CSS file, but I am still unable to figure out how to push the numbered list into action.</p>
		<div/>

		<h3>Results<h3/>
		<div>
			<p>Below are screenshots of my HTML and CSS files, as well as the results in a browser. The CSS connected smoothly, but as stated above, I was unable to actually view my website with my github ID.</p>
