		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures (Patty Pieper)<h1/>
			<p>This lab was supposed to create a local file structure, thus linking files together.</p>

		<h2>Challenges<h2/>
		<div>
			<p>I enjoyed formatting this website. I initially had a lot of trouble when actually connecting the links on the numbered list, but I was able to add images and connect a CSS file, and eventually push the numbered list into action after adding more details to the links(..).</p>
		<div/>

		<h3>Results<h3/>
		<div>
			<p>Below are screenshots of my HTML and CSS files, as well as the results in a browser. The CSS connected smoothly, and after realizing I had to specify which lab I wanted to view as an actual website, I was finally able to successfully do so!</p>
