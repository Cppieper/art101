				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>This assignment caused some troubles when trying to impliment buttons, but ater some collaboration with my partner, we were able to put a button on the site that allows the user to keep creating buttons.</p>

				<h4>Results</h4>
        <p>After much time dedicated, we were finally able to incorporate a button, as stated above, that allows the user to create more buttons. </p>
				<input type="text" id="name"><br>
				<button class = 'sort' id = 'sort'>Sort! </button>
				<div class = "output" id = "output">
